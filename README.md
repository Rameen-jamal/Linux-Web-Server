Real-Life Web Application Server in C
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a lightweight, real-time web server implemented in C, demonstrating key Operating System (OS) concepts such as multi-processing, multi-threading, inter-process communication (IPC), synchronization, and memory management. The server will efficiently handle concurrent client connections and serve both static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images) and dynamic content using CGI (Common Gateway Interface).

This README covers Phase 1 of the project, which includes the basic implementation of the server.

ðŸš€ Phase 1: Implemented Features
âœ… Core Server Architecture â€“ Basic request handling and client-server communication.
âœ… Socket Programming â€“ Implemented socket(), bind(), listen(), and accept().
âœ… Static File Serving â€“ Supports HTML, CSS, JS, and images with correct MIME types.
âœ… 404 Error Handling â€“ Returns an error message when a file is not found.

ðŸ”œ Next Steps (Phase 2 Goals)
ðŸ”¹ Implement Multi-threading with pthread to handle multiple clients.
ðŸ”¹ Introduce Synchronization Mechanisms (Mutex Locks & Semaphores).
ðŸ”¹ Add Logging & Request Monitoring for debugging and tracking.
ðŸ”¹ Improve Performance with caching mechanisms.
